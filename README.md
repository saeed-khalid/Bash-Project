Bash Script Project

For my Bash project I decided to pursue what was the suggested in canvas, Log analyzer. It counts Errors and Failed attempts in the code. 

You can run "./log_analyzer.sh -h" for a list of options. to display the information on how to use the script. 

I don't have a Var/Log/ file so I created a test file. 
 

To detest the test_file.sh run the following: "Replace the path of the file if necessary"
1- ./log_analyzer.sh -f /Users/saeedabuzaid/Desktop/Bash-Project/test_file.sh -e "ERROR" -c
2- ./log_analyzer.sh -f /Users/saeedabuzaid/Desktop/Bash-Project/test_file.sh -e "failed" -c
